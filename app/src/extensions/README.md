# CodeMirror 6 Extensions

Collabify uses these CodeMirror 6 extensions to create it's Markdown editor.

- `rich-text-clipboard` parses rich-text pasted in from other applications, and includes rich-text when copying out.
- `emoji` renders `:shortcut:` emojis.
- `markdown` is a group of extensions which create a hybrid WYSIWYG mode.
- `selection-state` helps power the editor's toolbar.

If there is interest in having these extensions published so others can build on top of them, please reach out and I can prioritise doing so :)
